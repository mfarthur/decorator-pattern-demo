# Decorator Pattern Project  

This repository contains a Java project showcasing the **Decorator Design Pattern**, which will be presented during a seminar on **November 19, 2024**.  

The **Decorator Pattern** is a structural design pattern that dynamically adds behavior to objects, promoting flexibility and code reuse.  

## ðŸ“– Context  

The project is inspired by the book *Head First Design Patterns* (2nd Edition, 2020), which offers a practical introduction to object-oriented design patterns.  

## ðŸš€ How to Run  

1. **Requirements**:  
   - Java 8 or higher  
   - An IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ) or a terminal for compilation  

2. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
   ```  

3. **Compile and Run**:  
   From the terminal, navigate to the project directory and execute:  
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   java Main
   ```  

   Alternatively, import the project into your preferred IDE.  

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure  

- **/src**: Source code illustrating the Decorator pattern.  
- **/docs**: Supporting documentation and presentation slides.  
- **/tests**: Unit tests to validate the implementation.  

## ðŸŒŸ Features  

- Detailed implementation of the Decorator pattern.  
- Well-commented code for easy understanding.
